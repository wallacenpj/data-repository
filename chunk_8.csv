350,27939,white :: because white does not absorb heat because its not an dark color.,0
351,27940,light gray :: Light grey paint would keep the doghouse a mutual temperature. With a light grey colored paint on the doghouse the house would not be too hot on a sunny day like a darker color would make it. And on a cold day the dog house would not be too cold with a light grey paint.,1
352,27941,white :: This color will make the doghouse cooler so the dog will be more comfortable in the hot sun. According to the experiment the white-colored lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the 4 lids. It was 42 degrees  in the white lid for trial one and 54 degrees  for the black lid on trial one.,2
353,27942,black :: Choosing the color black will affect the doghouse because dark colors absorb more energy,1
354,27943,"dark gray :: i would paint the dog house dark gray, this way the dog house is warm in the winter but not too hot in the summer.",1
355,27944,"dark gray ::  The color Dark Gray would affect the temperature of the doghouse because, as the data shows, a darker color results in hotter temperatures. The data shows that the average temperature was 53 degrees celsius  for black, which would be too hot for a dog house. The Dark Gray however, had a lower temperature of 48 degrees celsius , which would be the correct temperature to keep a dog warm, but not hot.",1
356,27945,dark gray :: if it is a hot day the dog house will not get too hot and if it is a cold day the dog house will not get too cold. the average temperature for the jar with the dark gray lid under the lamp is 45 degrees celsius ,1
357,27946,"white :: this color would not make it as hot inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster, the black heated up to 53 degrees  and the white only heated up to 42 degrees ",2
358,27947,"light gray :: The color light gray might affect the doghouse by balancing out the temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse. This also might be the most comfortable temp for the dog. Since, in Brandi &amp; Jerri's investigation, after being placed under a lamp for 10 minutes, the air temperature inside of the light gray lid jar was 45 degrees celsius. While the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees celsius were: White-42, Dark Gray-48, &amp; Black-53. So, a light gray doghouse would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black doghouse, In which I would assume to be a more comfortable temperature.",2
359,27948,light gray :: I think that light grey would be a good color for a doghouse because this color would make the doghouse not too hot and not too cold. According to the lid experiment light grey had averaging temperatures of 44-46 compared to the black average of 52-54 and the white average of 41-43. The averages for the light grey lid are moderately cool which would be a good choice for a dog so they do not overheat or freeze .,2
360,27949,white :: white would be the less warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice,1
361,27950,black :: brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most. according to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because black got an average of 53 degrees  and white got an average of 42 degrees . so therefore black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside.,2
362,27951,"white :: The lighter the color, the less heat that color will attract/absorb",1
363,27952,"white :: White will keep the inside of the dog house cooler. The average temperature for white was 42 degrees celsius  after 10 minutes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color, grey, at 45 degrees celsius ",2
364,27953,white ::  Because the others takes in the light more than the white paint,0
365,27954,"white :: White would have a lower temperature inside the doghouse, Making it nice and cool for the dog.",1
366,27955,"white ::  If you chose to paint the doghouse white than it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in/cool off on hot summer days. White would decrease the temperature of the dog house because in the Air- Temperature experiment, the color black (the darkest lid) had the highest avg. temperature inside of the glass jar which was 53 C. the lightest color of lid (white) had the lowest avg. temperature inside of the glass jar and it was 42 C. The difference between the dark lid (black) and the light lid (white) was 11 C. So therefore the lighter the color in this case white, will attract the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature.",2
367,27956,"white :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse white, then the light would reflect off he dog house. If they painted it black then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and (if temperature gets hot enough) possibly even burn or catch on fire.",1
368,27957,light gray :: The white may be best because it is the coolest color (temperature) as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house.,2
369,27958,light gray :: light gray will be the best color because it will absorb some heat but also keep the dog from getting too hot in the summer. The temperature where around 45 degrees celsius  which is good for a dog,1
370,27959,white :: That color will absorb the least amount of light keeping the dog house cooler,1
371,27960,white :: White will keep your dog house cooler on the inside rather than using a dark color like black because that will attract more heat.,2
372,27961,dark gray ::  The color dark grey would be the best color to paint the dog house. The color dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as the black. I know this because the average of the black in the experiment is 53 degrees celsius  and the average temperature for dark grey is 48 degrees celsius ,2
373,27962,black :: black might effect the dog house because in the chart black has the highest temperature of all colors,2
374,27963,"white :: Using white paint for the doghouse will keep it cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53 degrees celsius  and the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 degrees celsius . The jar with the white lid was an average of 11 degrees celsius  cooler than the jar with the black lid.",2
375,27964,"light gray :: Light grey would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer, but will also will absorb more light than white, so it will be warmer in the winter.",1
376,27965,white :: White would be a good color to paint the dog house because in the trials white had the cooler temperature.,1
377,27966,dark gray :: I would choose light gray because it would keep the dog nice and cool during day and warm at night . also depends on where they live.,1
378,27967,black ::  Black would make the inside of the doghouse warm because the darker colors absorbs the heat from the sunlight. So if Brandi and Jerry used the color black for the lid of the glass jar then the lid would absorb more of the heat from the bulb. If Brandi and Jerry you sed the color white for the lid then the lid would not absorb much of the heat from the bulb.,1
379,27968,"black :: It will keep the house warmer in the winter. The black lid had a average temperature of 53 degrees celsius  and the Dark gray had the average of 48 degrees celsius . The Light gray had an average of 45 degrees celsius  and the white had an average of 42 degrees celsius . Therefore, the black colored roof is the best.",2
380,27969,"black ::  Black being the color of the doghouse might affect it by making it warmer (higher temperature) because it absorbs more light energy. In the results, the temperature was 53 degrees celsius  while with the white lid was only 42 degrees celsius , showing that black resulted in the highest temperature (was the warmest).",2
381,27970,"light gray ::  it would make it so it is not too hot, but not too cold either.",1
382,27971,dark gray :: The best paint for it will be the dark gray because darker colors absorb more energy.,0
383,27972,white ::  White would change the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color or the darker the color the cooler or hotter the air will be inside the doghouse. So if the doghouse was white the air temperature will be cooler than the black air temperature doghouse. I know that dogs like cooler air better than hotter air,1
384,27973,light gray :: if it is black then it will get hotter inside unlike gray it will not,1
385,27974,"white :: If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house white, it would keep it cooler. When they did the lid experiment, the average for the darker lid was highest (53 degrees celsius ). If they were to paint the dog house a darker color it would become hotter quicker. The average for the white paint was 42 degrees celsius  so it proves that painting the dog house a lighter color will keep it cooler.",2
386,27975,"dark gray :: I think dark gray is the best color because in the winter it will not be so cold because it will get some of the sun and heat up, and also in the summer it would not be so hot from the sun, so the dog could always be in his/her dog house any time of year.",1
387,27976,black :: The black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint. The average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid was 53 degrees celsius . The average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 degrees celsius . The jar with the black paint was 11 degrees celsius  warmer than the jar with the white lid.,2
388,27977,"black :: If they were to choose black for their paint color, they would find that the dog house would attract more heat because that is what darker colors do; attract heat.",0
389,27978,"white ::  They should use the color white because the color white does not attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it cooler inside of the dog house, the results show that in all the trials white was in the low 40's, and all the other colors like light grey and black were in the high 40's and low 50's. Therefore the dog house would be cooler with white paint.",2
390,27979,black ::  Using black with attract more sun and it would be hotter inside the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it warm I would light gray.,1
391,27980,"white :: I think white because the inside will be cool er as shown in the experiment. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment was 43 degrees  where as the blacks highest temperature was 54 degrees  , which proves the white is cooler.",2
392,27981,"white :: I choose white ,this mite affect the dog house by making cooler in hot weather. I choose this because in the experiment white had the coolest temperature",2
393,27982,"white ::  If Brandi and Jerry painted the dog house white, then in the sun light the dog house will stay to an average of about 40-45 degrees celsius  because the color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house.",2
394,27983,white :: It will stay cool and if it was black it would be too hot for the dog.,1
395,27984,black :: the darker the color the warmer the dog house is going to be because dark colors absorb more light then other colors,2
396,27985,"white ::  this color would be good for a dog because if the dog needs to cool off the white color attracts less heat. i know this because the average temperature for black was 53 degrees , for dark gray it was 48 degrees , for light gray it was 45 degrees  and for white it was 42 degrees  therefore white attracts less heat",2
397,27986,"dark gray :: I would chose Dark Gray because in the summer it would be nice and cool and in the winter it would not freeze. The average temp. is 48 degrees , though out all the trials.",1
398,27987,white :: because not absorb much energy this color.,0
399,27988,"white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because the affect on the doghouse is that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then if Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse black. This is because black absorbs more energy, causing the inside of the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects (energy) light so it'll keep the inside of the doghouse cooler. From the experiment, when a black lid was used, the temperature inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsius  but when a white lid was used, the temperature inside the glass jar was 42 degrees celsius . So as you can see the lighter the color of the lid, the cooler the temperature inside the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid, the warmer the temperature inside the glass jar will be.",2
