0,27589,black :: This color could possibly make the dog house warmer.,1
1,27590,white ::  It will affect the doghouse by making it nice and fresh inside the doghouse,0
2,27591,white ::  brandi and jerry would have to paint the doghouse white because; the sun does not make a lot of white things hot. Cause on the data table it shows that the color white does not effect the sun a lot since its a lighter color.,1
3,27592,"white :: White does not absorb as much light as a dark er color making the inside of the doghouse not as warm as it could be. In the experiment, the lowest temperature average was white with 42 degrees . The next temperature was light gray with 45 degrees , after that it just goes up higher",2
4,27593,black :: I would pick black. This color will effect the dog house by keeping the dog house warm. My support is that in the data table it shows that the Average temperature for the color black inside a glass jar was 53 degrees celsius  And the lowest temperature was white and whites Average data was 42 degrees celsius . Dark Grey and Light Grey had a median of 48 degrees celsius  for Dark Grey and 45 degrees celsius  for Light gratis shows that the Black color would keep the dog the most warmest,2
5,27594,"dark gray ::  Using dark gray would make the dog house an average of 48 degrees celsius . If you used black it would be too hot in the summer but if you used white it would be too cold in the winter, and the reason why I did not choose light gray is because the dog would most likely be in the dog house at night when it is colder and not so much during the day, especially in the summer.",1
6,27595,"light gray :: By using this color for the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse because it will be about 45 degrees  inside, which is not too cold or too hot and that might make the dog happy.",1
7,27596,"white :: If the color of the dog house was white then the air temperature inside of it would be cooler than if the color was black. The average temp. for the color black was 53 degrees celsius , and the average temp. for the color white was 42 degrees celsius . The difference between them is 11 degrees .",2
8,27597,white ::  White paint would keep the doghouse cool. You know this because white had the lowest average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp.,2
9,27598,white ::  it does not absorb the light as much,1
10,27599,"black :: i say it should be black. First of all because, lesser air will go inside the doghouse, since its ah more darker color and plus it has an average of 54 degrees  in average of heat inside a glass jar.",1
11,27600,"dark gray ::  The dog house will be hot due to the absorption of heat from the color of the house, this will help the dog stay warmer during cold nights and the winters.",1
12,27601,white :: It will keep the heat out of the doghouse because white reflects heat and will keep the doghouse cool. I know this because of how the white jar heated up the slowest in the experiment.,1
13,27602,"black ::  Black could affect the inside of the dog house because it will keep the dog house very warm so the dog will not get cold. I think this is true because according to the data the average temperature of a black color was 53 degrees celsius , which was the high data and the average temperature for the white color was only 42 degrees celsius , which is the low data. And the black temperature was 11 degrees  warmer then the white temperature. so that means the black color will keep the dog warm.",2
14,27603,black ::  if they paint the doghouse black then the dog could sleep in it overnight because of the warmth. the average temperature of the black jar was 53 degrees while the white jar was only 42 degrees.,2
15,27604,white :: dogs have a lot of fur to keep them warm so on a summer day they want to cool down. Black is not a good chose because it absorbs a lot heat white does not. The color white will affect the dog house by being less hot then a black dog house will be.,1
16,27605,dark gray :: Its Would Be About An Average Temperature. It is Not 2 Hot Or 2 Cold.,1
17,27606,dark gray :: Dark gray might affect the doghouse because it would warm up the dog without the dog getting too hot.,1
18,27607,light gray :: this color would keep the dog house cool and keep a little warmth inside,1
19,27608,black ::  This color will keep the dog house warmer because it has a lower albedo. Also in the experiment it had the highest of the Average temperatures with 53 degrees .,2
20,27609,dark gray :: tgfyfgfgccghjhjhgcgtchfhjfgfcc,0
21,27610,white ::  from the results i would pick white because it was the coolest (as in temperature). that way the dog would be able to stay in a place that is not too hot and it provide protection from the sun. the lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors so it should not be that hot. so they should paint the dog house white or any other lighter color but not the darker colors.,1
22,27611,black :: it will not,0
23,27612,"white :: The white color will be the best because it is not as dark as black and white absorbs less heat than black, the dog house will be about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint. The showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other darker colors.",0
24,27613,"black ::  Having a black doghouse would make the doghouse warmer on the inside. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, using a black lid had an average of 53 degrees celsius , while the other lighter colors had averages of 48, 45, and 42 degrees celsius . Therefore, using black would be the best choice for a doghouse color.",2
25,27614,light gray ::  If the doghouse was black or dark gray it might get too hot for the dog. If it was white it might be too cold for the dog so i decided that light gray was a good color.,0
26,27615,"white :: The color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors absorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53 degrees celsius  and the white lid averaged a 42 degrees celsius , which is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature.",2
27,27616,"white :: I choose white for the color of the dog house, because that way it will not be so hot for the dog. In the experiment Brandi and Jerry found the lighter the color, the less sun it attracts.",1
28,27617,light gray :: I would use light gray because its more on the cooler side for temperature and it will not over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house.,1
29,27618,white ::  It will keep the inside of the doghouse from getting to warm during the summer.,1
30,27619,light gray ::  It might fit because black would not go eit the dog if the dog is a light color then a light gray if the dog is a dark color then dark gray would match him but the darker color the more they die it would be better if the doghouse was light gray because the lighter colors do not make you sweat more,0
31,27620,black :: the dog house will not affect the dog house the black paint for the doghouse will keep it cool.,0
32,27621,white :: White would be a good color because it would make the dog house be fresh inside not so hot. According to the data table white got the lowest average air temperature for how hot it gets but black got the most highest.,2
33,27622,"white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house white because the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperature inside the jar, and its average was 42 degrees celsius . This way the inside of the dog house will stay cool and not get too hot.",2
34,27623,"white ::  I think that if they were building a dog house they should use a white paint color, because then the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter.",1
35,27624,"white :: The white paint will keep the dog house cooler , because in the experiment, the white paint had the lowest temperature after ten minutes, being 11 degrees cooler than the black paint, with a temp of 54 degrees.",2
36,27625,dark gray :: Dark gray was the most consistent energy absorber. With an average of 48 degrees celsius  the dog house will not be too cold or hot and is capable of maintaining an consistent temperature all year long.,1
37,27626,white :: i choose the color white because if it is a sunny day outside and the dog wants some shade he will go in the dog house because the white does not attracted energy as much as black. the dog house will be nice and cool for the dog.,1
38,27627,white ::  it would stay cooler than a darker one would because it does not absorb energy like a darker one would.,1
39,27628,"light gray ::  Using the light gray paint would be good because its still dark to the point where it will collect energy but not a whole lot to the point where the dog is dyeing from the heat, but not light enough to the point where the dog is not getting any energy from the sun.",1
40,27629,white ::  The color of the dog house could affect the temperature making the dog house cooler. this is true because in the experiment the white colored jar was the coldest with and average of 42 degrees celsius .,2
41,27630,"light gray :: The color, light gray, will make the doghouse cool in the summer and still keep it a little warm in the summer.",1
42,27631,white ::  White will make it cooler in there so when its sunny out the dog can go in there and will not burn up. After 10 minutes the white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means its cooler then the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees,2
43,27632,black :: The color might affect the outside of the dog house because in the summer it might get lighter and the winter it might get darker,0
44,27633,"white ::  White would be the best color because white will keep the inside of the dog house at the coolest temperature. In the experiment, the black lid caused the inside of the jar to be at an average of 53 degrees celsius  and the white lid caused it to be an average of 42 degrees celsius . If the outside was black the dog house would be too hot and if it is white the house will be cool enough for the dog to live in.",2
45,27634,white ::  The inside of the dog house after being painted white might make the doghouse be colder. In the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 degrees celsius . In trial 3 it had 41 degrees celsius . The average temperature of white was 42 degrees celsius  the lowest average out of every color.,2
46,27635,"white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white because the temperature is not too hot when put under light. Black would not be a suitable color for the doghouse because its average temperature under a lamp for ten minutes is 53 degrees celsius  ; which is too hot. White paint however has an average of 42 degrees celsius  when put under a lamp for ten minutes. This means that with a white doghouse, the dog would not over heat.",2
47,27636,"dark gray ::  The color gray would absorb only some of the lights energy for heat, not as much as black and since dogs have thick coats you do not want it to be too hot inside the doghouse. Also it gets cold in the winter and Brandi and jerry's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be necessary to be at 0least somewhat warm in the doghouse. that is why gray would be the best color.",1
48,27637,"white :: Because in the summer, the white color will deflect the sun's heat, keeping the doghouse 10 degrees celsius ooler than if you would paint it black, because in the experiment, the air temperature inside of the jar with the white lid stayed in the low 40's, while the jar with the black lid stayed in the low-mid 50's, proving the white deflects heat, while black absorbs it.",2
49,27638,white ::  the doghouse will stay cooler on the inside.,1
