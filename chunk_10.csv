450,28039,light gray :: light grey so it is not get too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter.,1
451,28040,black :: Black would probably affect the doghouse because it would absorb more heat. Plus the experiment shows that black kept in the most heat.,2
452,28041,white :: white is the best color because in the experiment the white colored lid was the least one to attract heat and was the lowest in temperature.,2
453,28042,white :: If they paint the doghouse white then the temperature inside will be a lot cooler because the white lid was 11(DEG) cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore painting the doghouse white would keep the dog nice and cool,2
454,28043,"black :: it would affect the doghouse by always keeping it warm, because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the light more. and in the investigation the average for black was 53, the highest out of the rest, so that is my prove that it would make it warmer/hot.",2
455,28044,white :: if you use white the temp in the dog house would be less,1
456,28045,white :: the inside of the dog house will not be so hot be cause white paint would not absorb a lot of heat energy,1
457,28046,"dark gray ::  The inside of the dog house would be moderately warm with dark gray at 48(DEG)c, Black would make it hot at 50(DEG)c, light gray would make it cool at 45(DEG)c, and white would keep it cold at 42(DEG)c.",2
458,28047,"dark gray :: I believe that the doghouse should be dark gray because not only the temperature from the experiment, but also the suitable conditions for a dog. According to the data the average temperature is at 48(DEG)C while the color black is at 53(DEG)C. For a dog to live in a doghouse the temperature should not be too hot or too cold.",1
459,28048,"dark gray ::  If the color is dark grey for the doghouse than it would keep the dog warmer during harsh weather yet not too warm for very warm seasons. In the investigation Hot Lamp, the lid color that increased the inside temperature the most was the black colored lid with an average temperature of 53(DEG) C, however the second highest was the dark grey lid with an average of 48(DEG) C. So, the dark grey roof would be the perfect color for the house, to keep the dog at a comfortable temperature.",2
460,28049,"black :: Because , The darker the lid color , the greater the increase in the air temperature in the glass jar.",1
461,28050,dark gray :: The best paint color would be dark gray because it keeps heat inside the dog house because of the color and when its warm out it will not be too hot to stay in for the dog.,1
462,28051,"black ::  I believe that the best color for the doghouse is black. This color may affect the inside of the doghouse by increasing its temperature, therefore, the dog can stay warm. I know this is true because the average heat in the experiment for black was 53 degrees, while the average temperature with white, for example, was 42 degrees. Clearly, black would be the best color for the doghouse.",2
463,28052,white :: white would be a good color for the doghouse because the white will not absorb heat and the dog will have cool place to go during the summer or hot days.,1
464,28053,light gray :: light gray because it is not that hot or that cold and it has a okay average.,1
465,28054,"white ::  White is the best choice because when they did the test with the lamp, the white lid was the coolest with an average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The black lid was 53(DEG)c, the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)c, and the light gray lid was 45(DEG)c. If they use black as the doghouse colour then the dog might get too hot if he/she stays in there to long. If they use dark gray for the dog house then he will have more time to get out of the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up. If they use light gray for the colour of the dog house then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog house than if the used black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating. If they use white as the dog house colour then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out before he/she over heats.",2
466,28055,"dark gray :: if they chose dark grey, the average temperature would be 48(DEG) which is normal so the dog house would not be so hot for the dog, but cozy and not as cold either.",1
467,28056,light gray :: i would go with the light gray because gray keeps heat in but not to much heat and gray lets the cold air out when its cold outside,0
468,28057,light gray :: you want one that will keep you warm in the winter but cool in the summer,1
469,28058,white ::  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house white because than the dog can stay cooler in the summer time,1
470,28059,"white ::  If they use white paint for the doghouse, the house will not be too hot for the dog, because during the experiment they found out that the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.",1
471,28060,white :: The color is going to effect the dog house by making the house fresh because dark colors consume more temperature.,0
472,28061,"black :: the color might affect the dog house because the darker the color is the warmer the dog house would be. In the experiment hot lamp, the darker the lid was the warmer the air got inside the jar. when the lid was black the temperature was at 53(DEG)(C) and when the white lid was on the temperature decreased to 42(DEG)(C).",2
473,28062,white :: white because the white gets less heat than the other colors. black got an average of 53(DEG)c. the dark gray got an average of 48(DEG)c. and light gray got an average of 45(DEG)c. but the white got an average of 42(DEG)c. so it should be white.,2
474,28063,white :: it white because white would keep the dog house cooler than all the other coior,1
475,28064,"dark gray :: The color might affect the inside of the dog house because the average temperature is 48(DEG)C , and in trial 1 ,2 ,and 3 the temperature was 48(DEG)C also .",0
476,28065,black :: A black dog house will hold heat better than any other color. I know this because in the lid experiment black's air temperature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white.,2
477,28066,black ::  black is the best at capturing and keeping heat. its average heat was 53,1
478,28067,black :: With a darker color during the winter the dog would not be as cold. With black the average temperature would be 53(DEG) C. The difference between White and Black was 12(DEG) C hotter in the black jar then the white jar.,1
479,28068,"white :: White would effect the inside of the dog house because white clearly kept the air temperature inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black, dark gray, or light gray. The average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG)C while the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG). Although the dark gray lid and the light gray lid did not have such an extreme difference from the white lid, the dark and light gray lid still rose the air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature which was 24 (DEG)C. Also on average the black lid rose the air temperature in the glass container 29(DEG)C from the starting temperature while the white lid only rose the air temperature 18(DEG)C from the starting temperature on average. That is a difference of again 11(DEG)C.",2
480,28069,"white :: If Brandi and Jerry use white, the dog house will not be as hot, or higher temperature, because white attracts the LEAST amount of heat.",1
481,28070,"white :: I think that white would be the color because according to the experiment, white had the lowest temperature so the dogs would not get too hot.",2
482,28071,black :: it will give it more air and light for the dog,0
483,28072,white ::  It might affect it because the darker the color the hotter it is,1
484,28073,"light gray :: I chose light gray because say its a really cold day outside, and your dog is inside his doghouse. I will bet he is really happy that you did not chose to paint it white instead.",0
485,28074,"light gray ::  if you choose cark grey the inside of the dark house will not be to warm or too cold. when you used black it had an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat. the white on the other hand is 42 degrees and is not absorbing as much of the warm ness. you would not want the doghouse to be to warm or too hot so if you chose light the dog could have a perfect temperature , because he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to become so warm and become faint. so light gray which collects 42 degrees on an average is better",1
486,28075,white :: I chose white because the color white does not absorb as much heat as black so the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot.,1
487,28076,light gray ::  they liked it because they like dog house's,0
488,28077,black ::  if brandi and jerry increased the darker the doghouse(black) then the doghouse will be a lot hotter because the darker the dog house the more energy is absorbed.,1
489,28078,white ::  Based on the data white will make the dog house cooler. Light colors do not absorb as much heat as dark colors. In conclusion white would be the best color for the hot weather.,2
490,28079,"black :: According the experiment, the black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside the jar to be higher, therefore making a black-painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors.",2
491,28080,"light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for a doghouse because a black dog house is too hot for the dog, being 53(DEG)C on average. The white doghouse would be too cold from only having 42(DEG)C inside. The only options left are dark gray and light gray, but with the heat coming off from the dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. Therefore, light gray, with 45(DEG) C on average, would be a better color to paint a doghouse than dark gray, with 48(DEG)C on average.",2
492,28081,white ::  If it is white then the air in the dog house will stay cool on hot days.,1
493,28082,"white :: they should use white because the average temperature of white was 42(DEG)C, and the average temp of black was 53(DEG) C. Therefore, the color white would keep the dog coolest.",2
494,28083,dark gray ::  A dark gray dog house would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot in the sun. In the experiment the jar with the dark gray lid did not have the hottest or the coldest air inside.,2
495,28084,white ::  le color se be mas bonito que los otros.,0
496,28085,white :: The color white will keep away the heat on hot summer days keeping the doghouse cool.,1
497,28086,"dark gray :: The color dark gray will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse warm. Not too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter. The data table on ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar"" says that the average temperature for dark gray lid is 48(DEG)C. This shows that it is a good temperature for most weather.",1
498,28087,white ::  this will make the doghouse the coolest because it is average data was only 42 degrees C. This will keep the dog the coolest during the summer time,1
499,28088,"black :: The color of the doghouse being black will best maintain heat during cold seasons or periods of time. During the hotter seasons, the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse. Thus, overheating is not an issue.",0
