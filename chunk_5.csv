200,27789,"black ::  A black roof will keep the doghouse warm. The average temperature of the black lid was 53 degrees celsius , but the average for the next highest color was 48 degrees celsius . Therefore, a black roof will keep the dog at least 5 degrees celsius  warmer than any other color.",2
201,27790,"dark gray ::  Dark grey would keep it to a cool temperature, but not too cold, and not too warm. Which is good for a dog.",1
202,27791,"white ::  I chose white because it is the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur, so then they can escape the sun in a shady, cool dog house. There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees C and white who's highest was 43. In the winter they will have a big fur coat , so they will not need it warm inside their dog house, plus there is not as much sun. If its too cold they can go inside the house.",2
203,27792,black :: because it increases the energy,0
204,27793,white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by making it more dirty and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where.,0
205,27794,white :: so you can see the dog in its house,0
206,27795,"light gray ::  I think Light Gray would be the best paint color because it is not going to make the dog house that hot but you also do  not want it to be too cold so it is a comfortable temperature. Light gray averaged about 45 degrees celsius  while white averaged 42 degrees celsius , Dark Gray at 48 degrees celsius , and Black at 53 degrees celsius .",2
207,27796,"light gray ::  It will keep the dog warm but not as hot as using Black or Dark Grey paint, The average temp for Black is 53 degrees  and the average for the Light Grey paint is 45 degrees  an 8 degrees  difference.",2
208,27797,white :: they dog house would be cooler and not has hot as a black or darker color dog house would be making it better to be in on a hot day,1
209,27798,"black ::  Black is the best color to choose because in the experiment, it said that the black lid attracted the most heat so they should use black paint to trap heat in the doghouse for the dog.",1
210,27799,black :: It would make the doghouse's temperature rise .,1
211,27800,"white :: White paint would effect the dog house because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed. According to the data , the difference in temperature would be around 11 degrees Centigrade then the black colour. So the white colour would absorb less heat resulting in a less hot doghouse.",2
212,27801,"dark gray ::  Dark gray is the best choice because its not too hot and its not too cold. The average temperature is 48 degrees celsius  and the other are 53,45 and 42",2
213,27802,black ::  black would keep the house warm when the uv rays hit it they collect all the energy which is in other words heat,1
214,27803,white :: white would work good cause that way the doghouse will not get too hot and it would be more comfortable.,1
215,27804,white :: The best color to paint a dog house would be white because white reflects heat from the sun which causes the dog house to become cooler in temperature. My support to my statement is in trial 1 The white white lid jar was the least in temperature because the white lidded jar was 42 degrees celsius  and the Light gray lidded jar was 44 degrees celsius  and the Dark Gray lidded jar was 48 degrees celsius  and the Black lidded jar was 54 degrees celsius  also in all the other trials the white lidded jar was cooler in temperature then the different color lidded jars. So Brandi and Jerry should pick White to color there dog house if they want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog would not get too hot and die.,2
216,27805,"white :: the white color will be much cooler then the other colors because, in the experiment the darker colors made the inside of the jar hotter. but the white color hade the lowest temperature which would be the ideal color for a dog house.",2
217,27806,"dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray. This color may affect the inside of the doghouse because it would either keep it warmer or cooler, depending on the weather. The results from the experiment say that the dark gray lid made the jar 48 degrees celsius . in ten minutes, so it would keep the doghouse warm. It really just depends on the climate of where the dog live.",1
218,27807,light gray :: I picked light gray because I think the black and dark gray doghouse would absorb too much energy and make it too hot for a dog to be in. Whereas the light gray doghouse will not be too hot or too cold.,1
219,27808,white ::  White would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflects sun,1
220,27809,dark gray :: if there is dirt in the dog house it would be hard to see it,0
221,27810,"white ::  By choosing a white color for the dog house it will keep the dog cooler. I know this because in the experiment the average temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53, but the average temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42. Therefore the darker the paint color the warmer the dog house.",2
222,27811,"white :: The best color for the doghouse would be white, because it absorbs less energy than a black color, and the black lid average was 53 degrees celsius  and the white lid was 42 degrees celsius .",2
223,27812,white :: The color white will effect the dog house because the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would. So the white doghouse will be cooler in temperature.,1
224,27813,white :: it would be much cooler than if it was black,1
225,27814,white :: White color does not absorb as much light as black. Black color get hotter by direct sunlight because it is absorbing it while white color simply reflects the light so it stays at about the same temperature.,0
226,27815,"light gray :: the light gray color might prevent it from being either too cold or too hot. Also in the results, the color gray was the second to least heated of them all.",1
227,27816,white ::  it will make the dog house cooler than if you used black paint because white paint does not absorb that much energy,1
228,27817,"white :: The dog house will be cooler if painted White and more comfortable for a dog. In the experiment the temperatures for the jars(in  degrees celsius ) with the black lid were 53, dark grey 48, light grey 45, and white 42. The White was 11 degrees celsius  less than the hottest jar (Black)",2
229,27818,white :: white because it does not absorb as much heat as black,1
230,27819,"light gray :: the color of the paint on the doghouse will affect it in many ways. to begin with, it will change the temperature of the doghouse. if the doghouse were black, then it would absorb a lot of the energy radiating from the sun. because darker colors hold heat more. the white would reflect a lot of the heat of of the doghouse. making the temperature cooler then if it were painted darker. the dark grey is going to keep it warm, but not as hot as the black paint would. and the light grey would keep it cooler, but not as cool as the white would. so it would all depend on were you lived. and what temperature best suited your pet. the darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat. and the lighter colors are going to reflect more of it off. i would choose light grey for my doghouse though. because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white.",2
231,27820,dark gray :: If i were to paint a dog house the color i would choose would be dark grey. Because black would absorb to much heat during the hot days. And white would absorb no heat so during cold night the dog house would be very cold. And dark grey is just in the middle so it does not get too hot or too cold.,2
232,27821,dark gray :: Dark gray is the best color to paint a doghouse with for many reasons. One reason is that in the results of their experiment dark gray had the same temperature all 3 trial times and same average of 48 degrees celsius  this meant that dark gray is a good color for a doghouse because it will absorb the right amount of energy in order for the doghouse to maintain at the right temperature. Dark grayish not a too dark color but not a too light color either.,0
233,27822,black :: The color black will make the doghouse warmer . This is because in the experiment the average temperature for the Black Lid was 53 degrees celsius  compared to the White Lid at the average of 42 degrees celsius . This shows that the darker the color the warmer the object/doghouse will be because it absorbs more heat.,2
234,27823,"light gray :: I chose light gray because it is the perfect temperature. it is average temperature, 45 degrees celsius , is a very good temperature; not too hot and not too cold. If you paint the doghouse that colour, it will be warm, but only slightly. It would protect the dog from sweltering heat; but keep it from freezing.",1
235,27824,"light gray ::  If the doghouse were to be light gray, the air temperature would not be too low, but not too high. The average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is 8 degrees  while the difference between light gray and white is 3 degrees . This way, light gray would be perfect as an in-between.",2
236,27825,white :: the dog well be more comfortable in the dog house.,0
237,27826,light gray :: I chose light gray because it does not attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white does. Inside the doghouse in the winter would be nice because it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter. In the summer it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghouse was black. Another reason why I chose light was it had an average temp of 45 degrees celsius  warmer than whites average temp of 42 degrees celsius .,2
238,27827,white :: I think that white would be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temperature so it would be the coldest for the dog.,2
239,27828,white ::  White is the best color to choose because it reflects the sun's rays better than any other color. and it will not make the inside get too hot,1
240,27829,"white ::  White will not attract the light as much as any of the other colors, therefore allowing the dog to stay cool.",1
241,27830,"light gray ::  Coloring the doghouse light gray could keep the temperature inside the doghouse at a cool average of 45 degrees celsius , which is the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color vs. air temperature inside glass jar experiment.",0
242,27831,white ::  the best color would be white because the ins ide of the doghouse would be cooler because the color white attracts less heat energy then the other colors because the results show that white had lower temperatures than the other colors,2
243,27832,"dark gray :: brandi and jerry should use dark gray because it would be a comfortable temperature for the dog at 48 degrees celsius , which the data says is it is average",0
244,27833,light gray ::  It would keep it warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. The medium shade color is a fantastic way to keep a pet warm!,1
245,27834,white ::  because it will stay the coolest and the dog will not like it in there if its cold,1
246,27835,white ::  so the dog house doesn't heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can stay in his house longer,1
247,27836,light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse because darker colors absorb more light energy. So light grey would absorb some but not a lot keeping the inside of the doghouse cool and not really hot (45  degrees ),2
248,27837,light gray ::  it will be the right temp for a dog,0
249,27838,"dark gray :: I would choose Dark Gray because it will not absorb as much light as black would, but it still is a dark color to absorb some light. This would affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because it will not be too cold nor too hot in the doghouse. Comparing my choice to the experiment When they used Black as the lid color it gave the hottest inside air temperature. Dark gray was in 2nd place with a temperature of 48 degrees celsius , but I thought 45 degrees celsius  for the light gray would be too cold.",2
