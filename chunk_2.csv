50,27639,white ::  the color white would effect the doghouse's inside in a way were it would absorb less heat therefore it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house.,1
51,27640,black :: the darker color will keep most of the heat in the dog house than the color white would. the increase of the heat is because of the darker color in the dog house.,1
52,27641,white :: The paint color that i choose is white i choose this color because it will not make the inside of the dog house as hot . The color might affect the inside of the dog house because white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color would. In the summer instead of it getting up to 53(DEG) C with black paint it will be a cooler 42(DEG) C with the white paint,1
53,27642,"black ::  The black paint will keep the dog warm inside the doghouse during winter, just like how the black jar lid heated the air in the jar 11(DEG)C higher than the jar with a white lid.",2
54,27643,light gray :: the doghouse would not be too cold or too hot. i got this data from the table they made of all the averages,2
55,27644,light gray :: The light gray is a good color to choose because it will not be too hot in the summer and will not be too cold in the winter . The light gray was the 2nd coldest jar.,2
56,27645,white :: the color will keep the dog cooler and will not get the dog really hot. In the experiment it says that it got down to 41(DEG)C. And the lowest for others was 44(DEG)C.,2
57,27646,"white :: The temperature would be lower, because in the experiment the white lid had a temperature 11(DEG) below that of the black lid",1
58,27647,white :: i think white because white reflects the sun so its not as hot inside the dog house.,1
59,27648,white ::  to keep the dog house cooler a black dog house,0
60,27649,white :: because black attracts more heat than white,1
61,27650,"dark gray :: Because the results of their experiment showed that a dark color attracts more sunlight, it would be best to have a dark gray paint. Although, dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sunny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse and the dog would begin to dehydrate and would have to have it is water dish refilled two times a day. But, with a light gray paint on the doghouse, the dog would be able to stay cool during summertime!",0
62,27651,white :: the color white is the best choice because it will keep the doghouse colder. A white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 degrees.,2
63,27652,"white :: this color will affect the dog by keeping the dog cool in the summer because the darker the lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature...",2
64,27653,light gray :: this color would effect the dog house by keeping the air warm and cold so it would be the right temperature.,1
65,27654,white ::  I would make it much cooler for the dog in his new dog house.,1
66,27655,white ::  the white paint will keep the dog house cool when it gets hot outside,1
67,27656,"white :: The color white might affect the inside of the dog house to be cooler. The average of the three trials for white was lower than the average of the other colors, white was 3(DEG)c cooler than light gray and as much as 11(DEG)c cooler than the black.",2
68,27657,white :: because white draws the least amount of energy,0
69,27658,"dark gray ::  The best color to paint the doghouse would be dark gray, because dog houses are usually meant to keep dogs warm. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm, but not hot. Therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray.",1
70,27659,"white :: If the doghouse was painted white, the inside of the doghouse would not get too hot for the dog. This is because in the data table the average temperature for the light gray lid color was 42(DEG) C. Also, if the doghouse was painted black or any of the other colors, the dog would possibly get too hot because they are darker colors that absorbs more energy.",2
71,27660,"dark gray ::  It will warm the doghouse, and help the doghouse contain a consistent temperature, at 54(DEG) C",1
72,27661,white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler because in the experiment white had the lowest average temperature when it was put under the light for 10 minutes.,1
73,27662,"white :: I think the best paint color for the doghouse is white. I believe that since white is the lightest color of paint they have, it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler. The lighter the color, the less heat it will absorb. In the data, the average temperature of the air inside the glass jar when the lid was white was 42(DEG)C. For black, the darkest color lid they had, the average temperature of the air was 53(DEG)C. That's a total difference of 11(DEG)C.",2
74,27663,black ::  the color black would keep the dog house color.,1
75,27664,"black ::  Black is a good color to use because it absorbs heat. It would make the inside of the dog house warm, much like the hot lamp experiment. In the lab the lamp became hot because the black lid absorbed heat from the lamp. I think the black paint will absorb heat from the sun and make the dog house warm inside.",1
76,27665,white :: this color would be best because it would not get as hot as a darker color such as black making it better suited for the dog,1
77,27666,black ::  it will make the dog house warmer.,1
78,27667,"light gray ::  They should paint it light gray because, that color attracts heat but not so much that it would get so hot in there in the summer, and not too cold in the winter.",1
79,27668,dark gray :: this color might affect the doghouse by absorbing energy from the sun but you do not want black because you do not want it too hot for the dog.,1
80,27669,light gray :: it might make it look not as good but it will also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out . it will also be lighter inside at night.,0
81,27670,"black :: I would choose black for the paint color because the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun and heat up the inside of the doghouse. The black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C, which was the highest average temperature out of all the lids, and the white had a temperature of 42(DEG)C, which was the lowest. They had a difference of 11(DEG)C, meaning that the black paint would keep the doghouse warmer.",2
82,27671,white ::  i say white because is attracts less hot,1
83,27672,white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse because inside the doghouse the temperature will be lower than if using the paint color to be black.,1
84,27673,white :: white does not absorb as much energy as the other colors so the doghouse would be colder inside.,1
85,27674,black :: i chosed black because it will keep the house warm because on the table it clearly states that black absorbs more energy,1
86,27675,light gray :: when the dog house gets dirty it will not show the parts that are dirty because its the color black,0
87,27676,"light gray :: The light gray paint color would be the best because of the fact that if the dog was in the dog house it would not be too hot nor too cold. The data shows that the average temperature of the paint is as follows Black: 53(DEG)c Dark Grey: 48(DEG)c Light Grey: 45(DEG)c White: 42(DEG)c so you see that with the light grey it still will absorb some light, so it will not be too hot or too cold in there... the light grey is a perfect in between temperature for the dog house because too much heat for an animal is not good and so it too little heat.",2
88,27677,dark gray :: dark gray was the only color that did not either decrease or increase in temperature during the Hot Lamp experiment. If the built a dog house dark gray the inside of the dog house would not over heat.,0
89,27678,white :: They should use white as a color because it will not be as hot in the dog house than with a black dog house. Darker colors absorb energy and lighter color do not so white would be a good choice.,1
90,27679,white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse better because the doghouse will stay cooler.,1
91,27680,white ::  It will keep it the coolest out of all the colors. The temp for white was 41 to 43 while the other colors were ranging to 44 to 54(DEG),2
92,27681,"light gray :: I think that Light Gray would be best because it attract some heat so during the winter it will be warm. Then later, during the summer it will take in some heat but it will not take in enough to heat the dog up a lot so he will stay at a pretty well kept temperature.",1
93,27682,white :: it will keep it cooler,1
94,27683,white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because white absorbs less energy which would make the doghouse cooler for the dog. According to the experiment the white colored lid had an average air temperature of 42(DEG) C while the black lid had an average air temperature of 53(DEG) C.,2
95,27684,white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the inside of the doghouse will stay cool even during the summer. the data shows that the white lids average heat temperature was about 42 C and the black was about 53 C. white was 11 degrees cooler.,2
96,27685,black :: with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose because black absorbs heat. In the experiment the temperature for the black lid was always the highest.,2
97,27686,"black :: That color would provide the warmest environment for the dog in the doghouse, because the black paint would create the warmest air temperature. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid reached an average of 53(DEG), which was 5(DEG) more than the next highest temperature. (48(DEG))",2
98,27687,black ::  it would effect in the heat because it would be warmer,1
99,27688,"white :: the white house would be better because it reflects light way better than black because it absorbs the light, causing it to get hotter",1
