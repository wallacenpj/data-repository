500,28089,black ::  black is not a good color because it extracts heat from the sun and  the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and that is why they should not choose the color black.,0
501,28090,white :: White will keep the inside of the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside. The average for white is 42 degrees  instead of black being 53 degrees .,2
502,28091,"white :: because, it will keep you more warmer.",0
503,28092,white :: white would make the dog house colder,1
504,28093,white :: the color white would be the best for the dog house because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the doghouse cool and comfortable,1
505,28094,light gray ::  the light gray color will keep a maintained normal temperature,1
506,28095,white :: I would paint it white so on a hot summer day Brandi and Jerry's dog could cool down.,1
507,28096,black :: This color will affects the doghouse internal temperature. The darkness of the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside of this dog house warm.,1
508,28097,black ::  because is black,0
509,28098,white ::  the white paint would make the doghouse cooler. the black paint would make the doghouse warmer at 53 degrees celsius. the white paint would be 42 degrees celsius.,2
510,28099,white ::  it will make the dog house cool for the dog on hot days.,1
511,28100,black :: because it can be warm inside the dog house if the sun hits the black paint it can be hot in there and change the temperature,1
512,28101,black ::  el negro por que el negro consume el calor y el blanco no,0
513,28102,white :: White would be the best color because the temperature in the inside of the dog house would be colder than any other color,1
514,28103,"white :: The dog house should be painted white because it would make the dog house the coolest (coldest). Since dogs like the shade and cold to cool them down in the summer, white would reflect the most light energy and prevent it from becoming too hot. After ten minutes, the jar with the black lid heated up by 29 degrees C on average. However, the jar with the white lid did not heat up at all on average.",2
515,28104,black :: Having a black doghouse will be warmer.,1
516,28105,"white ::  white is the best color because it keeps it very cool, lighter colors like white reflex the sun light that makes it more cool and darker colors like black absorb that makes it more hot",1
517,28106,light gray :: i picked light gray because i thought i did not want the dog to be too hot in there by having it black or dark gray but then again i did not want the dog to have white just in case he will not get too cold so i picked light gray so he/she will feel just right,1
518,28107,"white :: I would choose White colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the experiment where black was for the first trial , 54 degrees celsius , then for the last trial also 54 degrees celsius . Where as White at its first trial got 42 degrees celsius  and 41 degrees celsius  for its last trial",2
519,28108,"light gray ::  Since the doghouse will have a living being in it, the temperature should be comfortable for the dog. 53 degrees celsius  is very, very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable, especially on a warm summer day. But, 41 degrees celsius  is too cold for a dog in the winter time, as this would be a year-round house for the dog. So, 45 degrees celsius  would be less hot in the summer, and more warm in the winter, which is just perfect for the dog.",2
520,28109,white :: it will not absorbs that much heat so it will cool inside the dog house,1
521,28110,"white :: White will keep the doghouse at a cooler temperature than any of the other colors will, thus preventing the dog from over heating. This is proven by the fact that after ten minutes, a jar with a white lid had an increased temperature of 18 degrees celsius , while jars with darker lids (ranging from light gray to black) had an increase in temperature of anywhere from 21 degrees celsius  to 29 degrees celsius . The white lid kept the jar cooler, so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well. This is healthier for the dog.",2
522,28111,black ::  the color black would effect the air temperature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorb more energy.,1
523,28112,"black ::  If you painted the outside of a dog-house, then the inside would be warmer. No matter what color you painted the inside.",0
524,28113,"white :: white would be the best color to chose for the doghouse, because white reflects off the sun. It does not absorb it like black, dark grey, or grey.",0
525,28114,"dark gray :: The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data. Also, the average temperature for dark gray is 48 degrees celsius , this shows that the color can absorb and reflect light, so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler.",1
526,28115,dark gray :: it will keep the temperature the same at all times,0
527,28116,"white ::  The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out. From the experiment, the white lid was the coolest out of all four lids.",2
528,28117,white ::  White will keep the doghouse cool because it reflects light instead of absorbing it,1
529,28118,white :: White will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black. White had a average of 42 degrees celsius  and black was 53 degrees celsius .,2
530,28119,"light gray :: Light Gray was the color I would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because, since black absorbs the most energy and the inside would have been hot. Dark Gray would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed. light Gray would have been a perfect color, not only absorbing the perfect a mount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors black and Dark Grey.",2
531,28120,"light gray ::  As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted, we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs. Knowing this, we would not want the dog to get overheated, so we would paint the dog house the lightest color available. Which in this case, is white. Though, the dog, being a live creature should not get too cold, therefore, light gray is the perfect compromise. Keeping the dog warm enough, but not too hot.",2
532,28121,"black :: This color black, could affect the doghouse because the dog could get very hot in the Summer time. Also, the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode.",1
533,28122,dark gray :: i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it would not be too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter,1
534,28123,"white :: During the experiment, Brandi and Jerry found out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. If the white color was painted upon the top of the dog house, then the temperature would not rise as much as the black colored paint because, jerry and Brandi made there experiment and got the results of white having the least affected air temperature when a lamp is directed at the jar. For example, on Trial 1, the white container had an air temperature of 42 degrees celsius  versus the air temperature in the black jar of 54 degrees celsius .",2
535,28124,light gray ::  its cool but it gets some heat for the dog,1
536,28125,white :: Its Going To Be Cooler For The Dog In The Ins ide Than The Darker Colors Because they do absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse very hot in the inside.,1
537,28126,light gray ::  light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it will not be too hot and its not to light so it will not be too cold the temperature will be just fine.,1
538,28127,"white :: it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors because it stayed in a temperature of low 40 degrees celsius . light gray was in high mid 40 degrees celsius , dark gray in high 40 degrees celsius , and black was in low 50 degrees celsius  proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature cooler",2
539,28128,"light gray :: I picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat. So that means lighter colors help reflect. Light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a little, and in the some helps reflect a good amount.",2
540,28129,black ::  they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter because more heat will be absorbed. The black lid was an average of 5 degrees  warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house,2
541,28130,light gray :: The temperature of the dog house would be from 44 degrees celsius  to 46 degrees celsius . The dog house will be at a neutral condition because it will not be too hot or too cold,1
542,28131,"light gray :: I choose dark gray because the light grey is perfect. Say that its a could wet day. The dog is really could. the dog could go into the dog house and stay warm without being overwhelmed with heat from his body and fur. the color's average temperature was 48 degrees celsius. it keeps most of the temp in but leaving some out. also it gradually was getting warm at a slow pace. which would help the dog a lot when it gets to summer time so he does not get over heated, buy the suns heat",1
543,28132,dark gray :: Dark gray is better because it will get hotter in the doghouse but not too hot.,1
544,28133,white :: the heat would be less attracted to white than the rest of the colours,1
545,28134,white :: it will not make it as hot it'll make it cooler,1
