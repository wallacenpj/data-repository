300,27889,"black :: black might effect the dog house by keeping it warmer because black attracts heat , it absorbs the heat .",1
301,27890,light gray :: This way the inside of the doghouse will not be too hot or too cold. The average temperature was 45 degrees . White would be too cold because the average temperature was 42 degrees . Black would be too hot because the average temperature was 53 degrees .,2
302,27891,white :: it will make it not as warm,1
303,27892,white ::  because white reflects the sun so it would stay cooler,1
304,27893,"white :: i chose white because its a very bright, cheerful and an elegant color and the dog will not get really hot like he would in black or dark gray.",1
305,27894,"white :: I think that the best paint color for the dog house is White. I picked this color because white does not affect the inside of the house with a lot of heat. So it would stay cool during the summer time for a dog. Because if you paint it black, sense black attracts the sun it would attract more energy and have more of the hot sun going in the dog house.",2
306,27895,light gray :: I chose Light Gray because if you put black it might be too hot because the trials where the average was 53 degrees celsius . for dark gray it may also get too hot hot because the average was 48 degrees celsius  . Light gray was 45 degrees celsius  and that just perfect it will not be too cold or too hot. White may be too cold at 42 degrees celsius .,2
307,27896,"white :: White's (color of paint) affect on the doghouse will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up. So in the summer, the dog will be able to stay cooler, longer. I know this because in the experiment, the white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by at least 2 degrees celsius  each trial.",2
308,27897,"black ::  i chose black because that means the dog house would be warmer on the inside, i know that because the average temperature of black after ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperature of white after ten minutes is 42 degrees.",2
309,27898,"white ::  Having a white doghouse would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler. The average temperature for the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees , while the inside of the jar with the black lid was an average of 53 degrees . The dog house would be on average 11 degrees celsius ooler.",2
310,27899,light gray ::  Since the darker colors were too hot and the lighter colors were too cold the light gray was kind of the middle so the dog will not be too cold or too hot,1
311,27900,white ::  You would choose white because instead of absorbing the sun light like black paint the white paint reflects it which would make the dog house more cool.,1
312,27901,"white :: The color that would be best for the doghouse in the SUMMER would be white. In the experiment with the effects of coloron temperature, the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperature, rising from 24 degrees celsius  to an average of 53 degrees celsius . But the white lid caused the least increase in temperature, rising from 24 degrees celsius  to only 42 degrees celsius . So if Brandi and Jerry want to keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer, they should choose to paint the outside of the dog house white, as it provides the least increase in temperature.",2
313,27902,white :: A white dog house would make it cooler inside . From the data the average temperature for white was 42 degrees celsius  which was cooler then the other colors.,2
314,27903,"white :: it will effect the dog house by absorbing less heat energy keeping the dog house cool, evidence from the table states the average temp. for white is 42 celsius.",2
315,27904,white :: I think they should paint the dog house white because when there is a dark color such as black it will absorb the heat so its best to use white so it will not be as hot in the dog house.,1
316,27905,white :: The color white will reflect more of the sunlight. which will make the house a colder temperature. White was the coldest temperature in the experiment. Its average was 42 degrees  which was the lowest temperature and black had the highest temperature which was 53 degrees  as an average.,2
317,27906,"white ::  wellâ€¦ if they were trying to make the doghouse nice and cool, they should use white. The color white reflects everything off of it making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool in. it blocks about 30% more heat than a black dog house.",1
318,27907,white ::  the white light will make the dog house have light in it.,0
319,27908,black :: i think black because it was the highest number on the average it was 53.,0
320,27909,"light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light gray. Light gray will keep the doghouse not too warm but not too cold . In the experiment the light gray lid let in an average of 45 degrees celsius . the black lid let in an average of 53 degrees celsius . The least heat let in was the white lid with an average of 42 degrees celsius . If i chose the white lid, the dog might be too cold inside his house. With black paint, the dog could be too hot inside his house.",2
321,27910,"light gray :: The best color for a doghouse might be Light gray because it would not be too cold and it would not be too hot. In the data it shows that the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 degrees celsius  and the others were 53, 48, and 42 degrees celsius ",2
322,27911,light gray :: i like that color so i chose that color.,0
323,27912,"dark gray :: Dark grey because black is probably too hot and white is probably too cold, but dark grey is right in the middle. It will keep the dog warm.",1
324,27913,"light gray :: This color was the in between color, or middle color. It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance, so for trial 1 it was 44 degrees celsius  for trial 2 it was 45 degrees celsius , for 3 it was 46 degrees celsius  and for trial 4 it was back to 45 degrees celsius . This is the best color, since it will keep the dog warm, but not too warm and not too cold either.",2
325,27914,dark gray ::  I think the best color would be dark gray because its not the darkest and the darkest color absorbs more heat. Its not the lightest so it will not be very cold.,1
326,27915,"white :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because in Jerry and Brandi's experiment, white was proved to be the coolest (in degrees) color. Versus black because the black lid attract ed MORE light.",1
327,27916,white :: reduced temperatures,0
328,27917,light gray ::  I chose the color light grey because with sun the temperature inside the dog house will be around 45 degrees  and t hat is not too hot and not too cold for the dog.,1
329,27918,white :: white is the best color for the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy than light colors. With white paint inside the dog house it is going to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house it is going to be hot. In the experiment dark color lids attracted more heat and the air was hotter than with the light color lids that is why white color paint will be a better color for the dog house so it stays cooler.,2
330,27919,white ::  it will be cooler then the other colors for the dog house,1
331,27920,"light gray :: Light gray might keep the dog house warm in the winter yet cool in the summer because in the experiment light gray attracts heat ,but not a lot of heat.",1
332,27921,"white :: well since the color is light gray instead of dark gray or black, it will not absorb as much heat, making a cool place to stay on a hot summer day. If it was light gray it would not be so bad either but white sounded like the best option. These facts are true because the experiment shows that a black lid did absorb more heat, while the others not so much.",1
333,27922,"dark gray :: A dark gray might make the inside of the dog house hot. Because darker colors absorb more heat energy. That would keep the dog house warmer at night, So that is why I picked dark gray. I also pick it because it will not absorb to much energy.",1
334,27923,white :: white doghouse would be nice and cool in it,1
335,27924,"white :: Because the color white reflects the light and heat better, in order to keep the doghouse cool it should be painted white. This will make the doghouse cooler inside, especially during the summer.",1
336,27925,"light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light grey, because then, the lightness of the doghouse would keep the temperature down, and then tint of darkness would keep it mildly warm.",1
337,27926,white :: it would reflect the heat and keep the inside cool,1
338,27927,white ::  the white color will make the doghouse cooler in the summer by reflecting the light,1
339,27928,"dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use the dark gray paint because that way the inside of the dog house is cool for the dog when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make it hot inside the dog house, and also the dog will not have troubles sleeping because the light will not really reflect into the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep.",0
340,27929,white :: White is the lightest color there fore it will attract the least amount of heat.,1
341,27930,white ::  white has more energy its cooler and black and all the other colors are darker then white. The darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light in,1
342,27931,"light gray :: The color ''light gray'' would be good for the dog house, because when it is hot the doghouse will not be that hot inside. Other than black and dark gray.",1
343,27932,white :: If it is white then the dog house will stay cooler and the dog will not over heat.,1
344,27933,light gray :: because they probably do not want it to be too hot or too cold so if they use dark gray then it would be perfect not too cold not too hot for the dog. the temp would have an average temp of 45 degrees  not too hot not too cold.,1
345,27934,"dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry choose dark gray for their dog house then the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house but will not be cold like a white dog house. Therefore the dog would be comfortable being in a cool, but at the same time warm doghouse.",1
346,27935,white :: dog houses are to protect and SHADE the dog and white does not attract heat,0
347,27936,"white ::  A white painted doghouse would make the internal temperature cooler because as the experiment has shown, the average in ternal air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42 degrees , while the other lids caused average temperatures ranging from 45 degrees  - 53 degrees .",2
348,27937,"black ::  Painting a doghouse black would help heat the house. From the experiment, black made the air temperature rise the most.",2
349,27938,white :: The color white might affect the doghouse because during summer months it will not absorb as much heat energy as a black doghouse would. although in the winter months you will want more of that energy absorb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the winter months.,1
