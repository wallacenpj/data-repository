400,27989,light gray :: because it had 5 more then dark gray,0
401,27990,"light gray ::  I chose light gray, because the inside of the doghouse will not be too hot or too cold if light gray was chosen. I learned in Brandi and Jerry's experiment that the darker the color of the lid was, the warmer the air temperature inside the jar was (after 10 minutes). If the dog house was light gray, the dog will be comfortably warm.",1
402,27991,white :: it will keep the sun from hitting him,0
403,27992,white ::  they should choose white because it attracts less heat so the dog can stay cooler,1
404,27993,black :: It will ABSORB HEAT BECAUSE BLACK ABSORBS HEAT,1
405,27994,white :: They should choose white because according to the data the white had the lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)c and it was the lightest color. If they chose black the dog house would be too hot. i know this because black has the highest temperature average(53(DEG) c).,2
406,27995,white :: Because hot and the black made the jar 53.25(DEG) (on average) while the white only made it 42(DEG) on average. Making white the better choice.,2
407,27996,white :: it would absorb less heat so the dog would be cooler than with black paint.,1
408,27997,black :: The average air temp in the jar was 53(DEG),1
409,27998,"white :: The color white is the best paint color for the doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool. White averaged at 42(DEG)C after 10minutes while black was 53(DEG)C, proving t hat the white color paint will keep the doghouse cooler.",2
410,27999,black :: Black would be the best color if Brandi and Jerry lived in a cold area because black absorbs heat more than any other color. According to their experiment the black lid had the highest temperature.,2
411,28000,"black :: Black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warm. Black was 11(DEG),8(DEG),and 5(DEG) more than the white, light gray, and dark gray paints.",2
412,28001,black ::  The color black attracted more Thermal energy than the other colors.,0
413,28002,light gray :: i chose light gray because the doghouse would be a little warm and a little fresh therefore the dog would not be as hot on a sunny day or as cold on a rainy day,1
414,28003,white :: This color will affect the dog house because it will keep it cool when it is hot outside instead of being really hot in side of the dog's house because it stays the coolest.,1
415,28004,light gray ::  so it will not be too cool or too hot,1
416,28005,light gray :: if you are going to paint a doghouse paint it light gray because the results of the experiment show that the darker the color the higher the temperature and you do not want it too hot but you want it a little warm so you would paint it light gray.,1
417,28006,white :: White will keep the doghouse cooler and your dog get overheated and sick.,1
418,28007,light gray :: The dog house would be cold but for the dog which would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would not freeze and it would not over heat.,1
419,28008,white ::  Black will make the doghouse warmer because black attracts the light.,1
420,28009,black ::  It would make the doghouse much warmer as seen in the jar experiment.,1
421,28010,white ::  it would be cooler inside the doghouse,1
422,28011,"dark gray :: The dark grey paint would keep the doghouse warm when it is cold out, but not as hot as the black paint when it is warm out. The dark grey paint got the inside of a glass jar to 48(DEG) in direct light in just ten minutes, so it should keep the doghouse at a reasonable temperature.",1
423,28012,white :: White reflects the suns rays,0
424,28013,"white ::  Since dogs have fur, they do not need to be any warmer so they should paint the dog house a lighter color. the black color was 53(DEG)c and the white was 42(DEG)c making the white color less likely to become hot",2
425,28014,"black :: in the data table it shows the black paint will keep the doghouse the warmest because, black absorbs more sunlight than dark gray, light gray or white paint",2
426,28015,black :: the color black will effect the dog house more because of the more energy it observes the temperature goes higher,1
427,28016,white ::  the doghouse would be build to cool off the dog so if you paint the doghouse white then the doghouse would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog cooled off.,1
428,28017,white :: white would be a good color for the dog house because a dog can get very hot during the summer so the inside of the doghouse will stay cool. in the experiment the white colored lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C when the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. Also out of the 4 colors the air in the glass jar with the white lid was the coolest,2
429,28018,black :: black would absorb the heat and keep the dog house warm in the experiment in trial one the temperature was 54(DEG)c compared to the color white which was 42(DEG)c the temperature was a big jump from black and white.,2
430,28019,white ::  It will keep the dog cooler because it was the least warmest in the jar.,2
431,28020,"white :: If they paint the dog house white, it would stay cooler compared to the black",1
432,28021,white :: having white paint would make the dog house c older so in the summer the dog would not be hot. The average for white is the coolest temperature (42(DEG)),2
433,28022,"light gray ::  I think that light gray is a good color because when it is sunny and hot outside, the darker colors will make the doghouse very warm and most likely uncomfortable for the dog. I did not choose white because although it is not a huge difference, light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot.",2
434,28023,light gray :: the inside will not be hot and it will not be very cold either. the light gray average temperature had an average of 45(DEG)C unlike the black lid which got hotter and had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.,2
435,28024,light gray :: I think that the best color to paint the dog house would be light gray because if you paint it black or dark gray then in the summer it will get too hot inside the dog house. But if you paint it white then it will get too cold in the dog house in the winter so i think that light gray is the perfect color to paint the dog house.,1
436,28025,black ::  based on the results in the experiment if they painted the doghouse black it would keep the air temperature inside the doghouse the highest which would keep the dog the warmest.,2
437,28026,white ::  If the doghouse is white the doghouse will be cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside.,1
438,28027,"dark gray :: The black color might affect the doghouse in a good way, because it will keep the doghouse warm when it is sunny outside. And the dog will not be cold it will be warm.",1
439,28028,"white :: Brandi and jerry should paint the  doghouse the color white. This color will affect the inside of the doghouse because it will absorb less heat and make the inside of the doghouse cooler than if you use a dark color because light colors absorb less energy. Evidence from Brandi and Jerry's Hot lamp experiment showed that the darker the color of the lid, the warmer the air inside the jar was. So if they plan to have a living animal inside (in this case a dog) I think it'd be more comfortable if the doghouse was not hot, they should paint the dog house white.",2
440,28029,white :: White is the best choose for the dog house because it will stay cooler then the other color,1
441,28030,"black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse black because in the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54(DEG), trial two 52(DEG), trial three 54(DEG), and the average they got was 53(DEG). So they should paint the doghouse black because it will stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black.",2
442,28031,white ::  I think it will not affect the doghouse because it is white and I do not think it well attract the sun as much as the black color well.,0
443,28032,"white :: If you design a white doghouse the chances are that the doghouse would be more cooler then the black, dark gray, light gray doghouses because the darker the color the more energy it will absorb. See because when they did the experiment the black lid absorbed more energy then all the others because of it is dark color, and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it is lighter color.",2
444,28033,"black ::  If Brandi and Jerry painted their dog house black it would absorb more energy from the sun and be warmer inside. I know this because in their experiment the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature. The average temperature of the jar with the black lid was 53(DEG)C which is higher than the dark gray (48(DEG)C), the light gray (45(DEG)C), and the white (42(DEG)C)",2
445,28034,"black :: The black paint would affect the doghouse, be cause it would absorb heat and insulate the doghouse, making it hot.",1
446,28035,light gray :: Brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light gray because in the summer time it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then the black and dark grey but a little warmer then the white .,2
447,28036,black :: using the black color for the dog house will make the dog house warmer because on the data of the lid color vs. Air temperature inside glass jar. the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 42(DEG)s so therefore the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint.,2
448,28037,black :: black because in the experiment it shows that black keeps heat in more,0
449,28038,white :: The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C which was the lowest temperature out of the four colors. White would keep the doghouse cool.,2
