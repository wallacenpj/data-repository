150,27739,"white ::  Since the color white's average was 42(DEG)C (the coolest temperature), it would be the best choice. Since white does not get as much heat, the dog in the doghouse would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse.",1
151,27740,white :: Choose WHITE!!! because it will not absorb much heat like black does 54(DEG) will make the dog house too hot. White is good because its a nice 41(DEG),1
152,27741,white :: because white gathers less energy which will make it cooler inside than any of the other colors.,1
153,27742,"black :: Using black paint to paint a doghouse would absorb more heat, as the data from the experiment shows. In the experiment , the jar with the black lid heated up to 53(DEG) on average, while white only heated up to 42(DEG) on average.",2
154,27743,white :: white is the best choice of color because the average temperature was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the dog house would be cooler with white pant,2
155,27744,"white :: On the graph, white is the one that had the coolest temperature, because the light went right through the color, so it did not get really hot. As shown on the graph.",1
156,27745,white :: using a white color on the dog house will decrease the amount of heat coming into the dog house therefore it will keep the dog house more cooler then those darker color's this is because white absorbs no color but its self,1
157,27746,"black ::  if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment, the darker the color, the more hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy.",2
158,27747,black :: because will keep dog warm,1
159,27748,white :: it is to lite so it would not let of as much lite.,0
160,27749,black :: black attracts heat,1
161,27750,white :: keep it cool,1
162,27751,"white :: White is the best choice since the highest temperature was in the black jar at 54(DEG), and the lowest was in the white jar at 43(DEG) showing an 11(DEG) difference, keeping the dog less hot in his house.",2
163,27752,dark gray :: because it can capture some sunlight,0
164,27753,white ::  I think that the doghouse should be painted white because the lighter colors reflect more light energy than the dark. The average temperature of black lidded jars was 53(DEG). The average of the white jars was 42(DEG). The dogs should live in a house that will not absorb too much energy so they will not overheat.,2
165,27754,white :: it will not be so hot,1
166,27755,white :: They should paint the doghouse white because in the data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would always be hot.,2
167,27756,light gray :: inside the doghouse in the summer it will keep it somewhat cool and in the winter it will keep it somewhat warm. also it was (in my opinion) the central temperature of them all being 45(DEG) C .,1
168,27757,white :: if they made a white doghouse the air temperature would not be as hot is if they made the dog house black because lighter colors absorb less light.,1
169,27758,dark gray :: It would keep it warm in the will noter and cold in the summer so the dog would not be too hot or too cold.,1
170,27759,light gray :: this color would keep the dog house cool in the summer and in the winter would still help heat the house the house would be warmer if the color was black,1
171,27760,black ::  The color might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because the darkness provides a type of covering that is like a insulation.,0
172,27761,white ::  white would absorb less energy in the doghouse making it cooler inside the doghouse,1
173,27762,light gray :: it will make it so it is nice and warm at night but still has enough heat retained at night to keep him/her warm,1
174,27763,black :: If the color is darker it will absorb energy,0
175,27764,"black ::  If you were to chose black as your paint color, it would warmer than the dark gray, light gray and white. In this experiment black got about 53(DEG)C and the white got 42(DEG)C.",2
176,27765,"light gray :: well if you have a darker color like black for an example it could be way too hot in the mid-day, but if you have a light color like white for an example it would probably be way too cold at night so a light gray color would be the just right temperature",1
177,27766,white :: Painting the doghouse white would allow the doghouse to stay cooler in the summer so that the dogs do not get too hot inside.,1
178,27767,"light gray :: I chose light gray because dog's eyesight only contains black and white sight, they do not see color like humans do. So a light gray dog house will catch dogs attention.",0
179,27768,"light gray ::  This color will make the doghouse stay cooler when it is warm and sunny, but it will also create heat when it is cold.",1
180,27769,"light gray :: This color can effect the doghouse by keeping it cool but to too cold and not too hot, because dark gray or black will over heat the dog, because of there fur.",1
181,27770,dark gray :: because it wasn't the hottest or coldest temperature so it would not be too hot or cold in the dog house it had steady results,1
182,27771,white ::  The white color would let the inside of the doghouse be cooler than the other types of paint because the white lid's average temp. was 42(DEG) C and the black lid's average temp. was 53(DEG) C. that is an 11(DEG) difference for the dog to feel.,2
183,27772,white :: because if you have a dark color the light will make it hot for he dog.,0
184,27773,"white :: The white paint color will reflect off heat and not absorb as much energy as the black paint which is a good paint color for the summer. The white paint color average for the temperature is 4 2(DEG)C, while the black paint color average for the temperature is 53(DEG) C.",2
185,27774,black :: Might affect the doghouse look nice for the dog,0
186,27775,white :: it would not heat up so fast,1
187,27776,"black :: I chose the color black for the doghouse because from the data collected, black was warmer than any other color with an average temperature of 53(DEG)C compared to the lowest temperature of 42(DEG)C for the color white. The dog in the house will stay warmer because black is the warmest color which I know by looking at the data Brandi and Jerry collected.",2
188,27777,"dark gray :: i think that dark gray could be the color because it would not be too cold or too hot. So in the summer the dog house could stay cool, and in the winter it could stay warm.",1
189,27778,"light gray :: I chose light gray because it will keep the inside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in an extremely hot place. The average temperature of the jar in the light gray jar was 45(DEG)C. So it is enough to keep the dog warm, but not enough to make it uncomfortable.",2
190,27779,white ::  White reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors. It also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids. This would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside.,2
191,27780,"white :: white because after 10 minutes of heat it gets to about 42(DEG) C and dogs should have cooling temperature, not hot.",1
192,27781,dark gray :: because it will keep the dog house warm,1
193,27782,light gray :: the dog house can either be hot or cold so there is not much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house.,1
194,27783,light gray :: The light gray color I think would be the best color to paint the dog house because the light gray color would absorb some heat energy to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler than black or dark gray and warmer than the white. From the experiment the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C. The white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white color would keep the dog cool but the white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm when needed.,2
195,27784,light gray :: the light grey soaks up heat but not too much .,1
196,27785,white :: this color might affect the dog house by not getting that much air inside. white has the lowest average temperature which is 42(DEG)C,1
197,27786,"white ::  I chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog. According to the data table shown, it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors.",2
198,27787,"white :: i believe white will work the best because it does not conduct as much heat as the other ones did: for example: black, dark grey, light gray, all got in between 44 and 54 well while the white paint only got 42-41 and 42 as an average",2
199,27788,"black :: If Brandi and Jerry pick the black roof then the inside of the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pick the dark grey, light grey or white roof. In the experiment, when Brandi and Jerry used the black lid, the temperature got up to 54(DEG)c and with the dark grey lid, it only got up to 48(DEG)c, with the light grey lid, the temperature got up to 46(DEG)c, and with the white lid, the temperature only got up to 43(DEG)c, so most likely the black roof would make the inside of the dog house hot.",2
