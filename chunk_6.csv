250,27839,"white :: Painting the doghouse white would affect it because in the summer, the doghouse would be cooler. In the experiment, the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42 degrees celsius  while the others were much higher.",2
251,27840,"white :: I chose to paint the doghouse the color white based off of Brandi and Jerry's experiment results. In the experiment, when they tested the lid color black, the average temperature inside the jar was 53 degrees celsius . This was the highest temperature out of the colors and the temperature raised by 29 degrees . Meanwhile, the white lid had an average temperature of 42 degrees celsius , therefore having the lowest temperature average. This time, the temperature raised only 18 degrees  after ten minutes. Compared to the black lid, the white lid raised to a temperature and had a change from the original temperature of 11 degrees  less. Ultimately, I chose to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the coolest. White had the lowest average temperature of 42 degrees celsius  and would keep any dog nice and cool.",2
252,27841,"dark gray :: i say dark gray because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that if it is cold outside, and it does not get it too hot for a sunny day outside. it is a 50/50 type thing warm enough and not too cold.",1
253,27842,"white :: Black: Average temperature was 53 degrees  Dark Gray: Average temperature was 48 degrees  Light Gray: Average temperature was 45 degrees  White: Average temperature was 42 degrees  Because of the cool temperatures, I would choose white as the doghouse color. With black, the doghouse would be pretty hot and uncomfortable for the dog.",2
254,27843,"white :: White would be the best color to have for a dog house because it is temperature would keep the dog house the coolest. In the experiment the white colored jar had an average of 42 degrees celsius , so that was the best choice and the worst choice was black. The black colored jar had an average of 53 degrees celsius , so that was the worst choice because it could be too hot for the dog.",2
255,27844,white ::  it will keep it from being too hot in the summer,1
256,27845,light gray :: It may affect the dog house because if its too hot then the dog will get too hot and if its too cold the dog would freeze so if its not too hot and not too cold the dog house will be good for the dog year around.,1
257,27846,dark gray :: This color will make the doghouse one temperature and not many different temperatures. In the experiment the dark gray lid stayed at 48 degrees celsius .,0
258,27847,"black :: If you would paint a doghouse you would want your dog to be warm, so painting the doghouse black would keep him or her warm.",1
259,27848,"white :: The color might affect the doghouse because the darker the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside. For example when tested the black got 53 degrees celsius , the dark gray got 48 degrees celsius , the light gray got 45 degrees celsius , and the white got 42 degrees celsius . you see as the color increases from dark to light, the temperature decreases.",2
260,27849,"white ::  I would choose the color white for the color of the doghouse because, it will make the inside of the dog house cooler for the dog so that during hot summer days the dog can stay cool and not super hot. The reason why this would work is shown on the trial board. While there was a black lid on a jar the average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes was 53 degrees celsius  When there was a white lid on the jar the average temperature of the jar was 42 degrees celsius . That is a 11 degrees  difference between the two lids. SO if you want the doghouse to be colder for the dog you'd want to get a white doghouse.",2
261,27850,"black :: Black, because if black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most heating average for their dog house.",2
262,27851,"white :: it cannot be black because black absorbs light. which would increase the temp, and white reflects light so that is why white kept the doghouse cooler at an average.",1
263,27852,"black :: If they were to use a black paint it would definitely increase the dog houses air temperature. According to the data the color black had an average of 52 degrees celsius . after ten minutes of the experiment, unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average temperatures .",2
264,27853,white :: The data table shows that the white lid jar took in the least heat. The black lid jar took in an average of 53 degrees celsius  after 10 minutes under the lamp. The white lid jar only took in an average of 42 degrees celsius . This is why the doghouse should be painted white to keep most of the heat out.,2
265,27854,"dark gray ::  If the doghouse were dark gray, it might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse. Heat is attracted to darker objects, so it would be warmer, but not as warm as it would be black. The data from the experiment shows that the black lid on average was 53 degrees celsius  , the dark gray lid was 48 degrees celsius , the light gray was 45 degrees celsius , and the white was 42 degrees celsius .",2
266,27855,black :: the color black could affect the temperature in the dog house because the color black can attract light and heat since the color black is an absence of light.,0
267,27856,"white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because then the inside of the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog to be inside it when it is sunny outside. I know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid, the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 53 degrees celsius  after 10 minutes, but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a white lid , the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 42 degrees celsius  after 10 minutes. So, if the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler.",2
268,27857,light gray :: it will affect the doghouse by it being cooler then heat temperature getting attracted to it.,0
269,27858,white :: White would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer because it reflects more light waves than it absorbs. In their test Brandi and Jerry found that white kept the jar the coolest,2
270,27859,white :: The white color paint will protect the doghouse from heat because it is not as dark. From the experiment it shows that a darker object stores more energy causing it to heat up in air temperature.,2
271,27860,"white ::  because the darker the lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy.",1
272,27861,dark gray :: It will keep the dog house inside warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather.,1
273,27862,white ::  Having white would make the inside temp. cooler because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42 degrees celsius .,2
274,27863,"light gray ::  light gray because when it is warm, the dog will want to stay cool and when the weather is cold the dog will want to stay warm. The results got higher and lower, for example, the first trial was 44 it increased by the second trial.",1
275,27864,"black :: black is a darker color, if you were to were a white shirt apposed to a black one on a hot day you will be warmer in the black shirt because it absorbs more energy.",0
276,27865,white ::  the color white because it will not attract as much energy or heat if it were darker,0
277,27866,light gray :: This color might affect the dog house by making it kind of cool and not so hot for the dog because it is not as dark as black so it will not absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as light as white so it will not be too cold,1
278,27867,white :: it would affect the doghouse because white is cooler than the dark colors. the average for white was 42 while the average for black was 53.,2
279,27868,"white :: If the doghouse is somewhere warm, it should be white to keep it as cool as possible inside the doghouse.",1
280,27869,black :: The black paint would insulate the inside of the dog house and keep it warm. The color black reflects heat. In the experiment black had the highest average temperature of 53 degrees  over all the other tested colors.,2
281,27870,"light gray :: T way this color might affect the inside of the doghouse by not being too hot because the darker the lid color, the greater the increase in the air temperature and because light gray is only 45  degrees celsius .",1
282,27871,white :: I would use white because it is the coolest color and it will not over heat the dog as bad unlike the other colors.,1
283,27872,"black :: If Brandi and Jerry chose Black, it would keep the dog house the warmest out of the four colors",1
284,27873,white :: it would keep the dog/ dog house the coolest on the inside. so it would not get too hot. where if you painted it black it would get much warmer in there.,1
285,27874,white ::  I would use white to paint my dog house because it would make it colder inside for the dog. In the experiment the white lens tested to stay the coldest inside the jar so the white paint on the dog house would make it so the dog house was colder for the dog.,2
286,27875,dark gray :: They might want to choose dark gray because it will make the doghouse not too hot as black and not too cold as white for it will still absorb heat and make the doghouse warm like the jar temperatures stayed the same at 48 degrees celsius  after heated. So the dog would stay more and obtain the same amount of temperature the whole time when heated most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures.,1
287,27876,white :: it will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler in it. it showed it was 42 degrees  and that is cooler than all the other colors,2
288,27877,white ::  the dog needs warmth,0
289,27878,black :: it will effect the dog house is by the color of the paint and the temperature. also it will effect it is because how dark is the paint.,0
290,27879,"black :: If it were to be cold outside, the black on the doghouse should make it warmer.",1
291,27880,black ::  The black would absorb the most thermal energy causing the dog house to have a higher air temperature (get warmer).,1
292,27881,white :: white will make it so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog,1
293,27882,white :: The white color attracts less heat so that way the dog is not too hot or too cold,0
294,27883,"black ::  The color black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature. In the results of the hot lamp experiment, the blacks air temperature got the highest average with 53 degrees celsius  .This is because dark colors absorb more energy.",2
295,27884,light gray :: light gray so the doghouse will not be so hot .,1
296,27885,black :: Well in cold temperatures like in the experiment you would want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because that color absorbs the most heat keeping the doghouse warm. If it was the summer time you might want to used white or light gray to keep the house cool.,1
297,27886,dark gray :: i would use dark grey because (based of were i live) its colder most of the year but its hot during summer so that way when the dog is inside during winter its warm and during summer its not too hot,1
298,27887,white :: White will keep the dog house cooler inside because its the lightest (brightest) color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black (darkest color) was 53 degrees C and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees C. Therefore making white the coldest color possible for the dog house.,2
299,27888,"black :: By painting the doghouse black, Brandi and Jerry will be allowing more heat to be attracted to the doghouse. The data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid was 53 degrees celsius , which is the highest average temperature of the four lid colors that were used in the experiment.",2
