100,27689,white :: White would keep it cooler in the doghouse longer.,1
101,27690,white ::  It will let the dog cool down on a hot day faster.,1
102,27691,"white ::  The average temperature from the glass jar experiment for the color white was 42 degrees. This is the lowest temperature out of the four colors (Black, Dark gray, Light gray and white). Using the color White would reflect the suns heat, causing the doghouse to be cool and not overheat. Therefore, creating a safe doghouse habitat.",2
103,27692,black ::  fdddfddf,0
104,27693,white ::  the color will effect the dog house by keeping it cooler than the other colors because in the experiment the white lid always had the lowest temperature.,2
105,27694,"dark gray :: I believe that the dark gray would be a good paint color for the dog house because depending on where they live, that dog house would not be too hot, nor cold",1
106,27695,light gray :: The Color Will Effect By Having Black And white Mix Because Black Brings Heat And White Is Cooling Color And Mix Them The Dog House Would Be Warm,1
107,27696,black :: After a while the doghouse color might fade out.,0
108,27697,dark gray ::  the color i chose till make the dog house warm but not too hot and dark gray stayed the same temperature at 48 for all 4 trials,1
109,27698,dark gray ::  when the heat stays the same outside it will stay the same inside too.,0
110,27699,"black ::  Using black paint color on the dog house will increase the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees, making it more comfortable for the dog.",1
111,27700,"light gray :: The light gray might affect the doghouse but not too much because the light gray is almost at about room temperature. If you put black in there, it will be too hot. If you put white in there it might be too cold.",1
112,27701,"white ::  By making the doghouse white, the air inside the doghouse would be cooler than with any other color. In the experiment Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, the jar with the white lid was only an average of 42(DEG) C after 10 minutes of heating. The jar with the black lid, however, was an average of 53(DEG) C after 10 minutes of heating. The jar with the white lid was an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefor, the color white will make the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the doghouse.",2
113,27702,black ::  it will make it hot in the dog house,1
114,27703,white ::  The color white would make the dog house absorb less heat and make it cooler. According to the experiment black got 53(DEG)C and white got 42(DEG)C so it should do the same with the dog house.,2
115,27704,black :: i think black so it will keep it insolated and warm for the dog,1
116,27705,"white ::  I would choose black because in the ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar"" Table It Showed That white was Colder than black and The rest Of the darker colors. For example the average for white was 42(DEG)C and the average for black was 5 3(DEG)C.",2
117,27706,white :: i would pick a white dog house because the white jar lid had the least amount of temperature increase. it only had about a an 18(DEG)C increase while the black jar lid had a 29(DEG) C increase.,1
118,27707,white ::  white will reflect the heat so the dog house will be cool,1
119,27708,white :: The white paint Because if you paint it a dak er color the results would be a hotter dog house and the results for a white dog house would be a cooler house.,1
120,27709,black ::  how it can affect is that when is really hot outside the doghouse can get really warm or like hot cause the sun is absorbing more energy.,1
121,27710,dark gray :: i think that brandi and jerry should use the color dark gray because if its summer and its really hot then it will not be too hot for the dog and wen its winter the dog can still be worm enough be cause the air inside in a jar like it shows in lid color vs. air temperature inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not too hot or to warm is dark gray and light gray so either of them is fine because you would not want the dog to freeze to death and you would not want it too hot,2
122,27711,"white :: It will keep the doghouse cool and not hot. When Brandi and Jerry put the white lid on, the average temperature inside the jar was 42(DEG) C. When they put the black jar on, the average temperature was 53(DEG) C.",2
123,27712,black :: black because the color black attracts the heat and it gets really hot.,1
124,27713,white ::  If the doghouse was white the temperature in the doghouse would be so much cooler than if the doghouse was black. White would be best for the doghouse because you would not want it to be too warm. White would fit the best.,1
125,27714,white :: white color will deflect more sunlight,0
126,27715,"white :: White will not affect the doghouse because in the results in the experiment, it shows that white was the lowest temperature than all the temperatures of different lid colors.",1
127,27716,black :: It will be warmer for the dog,1
128,27717,"white ::  White would be the best choice because it attracts less heat as shown in the experiment the jar with the white lid only got up to 43(DEG)C at the highest, and the black lid got up to 54(DEG) C at the highest. And the dark grey and light grey were in between.",2
129,27718,white ::  Painting the doghouse white would make it cooler inside the doghouse. I know this because the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was 42(DEG)C and the average temperatures for the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45(DEG)C.,2
130,27719,white :: because it has the least amount of air pressure,0
131,27720,black ::  painting your dog house this color will affect the inside by making it hotter is what i get from the chart and the results the kids who did this project.0,2
132,27721,"light gray :: Light gray does not absorb as much heat as black or Dark gray, which would help keep the doghouse cool in the summer time. It also absorbs some heat, at least more than white, which would help keep the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter. This makes it the optimal paint to use when designing a doghouse.",1
133,27722,white :: it will keep the doghouse cool.,1
134,27723,light gray :: If they use light grey then the doghouse will stay cooler because if the color of the paint is dark then it will absorb more heat as it did in the lamp experiment.,2
135,27724,white :: I think white because in the summer time the dog house is not too hot for the dog house and warm air can come inside the dog house door to make the inside a little warmer.,0
136,27725,"white :: The color white would reflect the light on the house, instead of absorbing it like the black would, keeping the house cool inside.",1
137,27726,white :: the white one will reflect more heat than the other colors,0
138,27727,"black :: i would chose a black for the doghouse because the air temperature would be hotter, therefore keeping the dog warmer in the winter time. i know this because in brandi and jerry's experiment, when the lid was black, the average air temperature was 53(DEG) Celsius, and when the lid was white, the average air temperature was 42(DEG) Celsius,",2
139,27728,"black :: They should use black paint for their doghouse. In the experiment, the air inside the jar was 5(DEG)C warmer than the second warmest color. The jar with the black lid was 53(DEG)C.",1
140,27729,"white :: It would keep the doghouse cool in the summer . after ten minutes the jar with the white lid was on average, only 42(DEG) C. The jar with the black lid however had an average of 53(DEG)C after ten minutes. This would be much too hot for the dog.",2
141,27730,black :: using black paint it will increase the temperature in the house so that their dog will stay warm,1
142,27731,white :: the color white does not absorbed energy from the sun. the color will make the dog house cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be as hot as an oven inside the dog house.,1
143,27732,dark gray :: my color is dark gray it might effect the inside because its going to make it look scary in there,0
144,27733,"black ::  It would increase the temperature of the doghouse, especially when close to light. Because darker colors make more heat. For example, when Brandi and Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colors. Black had the highest amount of heat. This is mostly because its an energy transfer. When light hits darker colors, it turns in to thermal and or heat energy.",2
145,27734,"light gray ::  Light gray could effect the temperature of the doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat than light colors do. If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house black, the house would absorb too much heat since in the data the average was 53((DEG)C), if you chose dark gray the average temperature was 48((DEG)C) which could still be too warm. If you chose light gray, its average was 45((DEG)C) which is right in the middle of being warm and cold and if you were to use white, the average was 42((DEG)C) which could be too cold in the winter time. therefore, using the light gray could help keep the doghouse warm and cool and the same time.",2
146,27735,light gray :: in the winter the dog might get cold so you make it a sort of light color so it can stay warmer. In the summer it will be hot and the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light color,0
147,27736,dark gray :: dark gray will not over heat the dog or change its temperature,0
148,27737,light gray :: Light gray would attract more energy than white which would keep it warmer but it would also stay cooler than black or dark gray.,2
149,27738,"light gray :: I think that the best color for a dog house would probably be light grey, that way inside the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. If the dog house was white, inside the dog house would probably be too cold since white does not absorb as much energy. I would not paint the dog house black though because it might get too hot, same with dark grey. So light grey would be the best color for a dog house.",1
